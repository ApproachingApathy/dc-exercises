# Intro to Redux Exercise - Counter

Create a basic incremental counter using vanilla JavaScript and Redux.

- Import the Redux script
- State will be a number
- Create a reducer to "INCREMENT" or "DECREMENT" state
- Create the Redux store
- Create a reusable render function to display the state value on the page
- Render the page on page load
- Render the page on a redux store subscribe, so the page updates every time the value changes
- Dispatch actions when the buttons are pressed
  - Increment by one
  - Decrement by one
  - Increment by one if the number is odd
  - Increment by one asynchronously

See `counter-start.html` for a helpful starting point to build the reducer, store, and actions. See `counter-solution.html` for a working solution.
